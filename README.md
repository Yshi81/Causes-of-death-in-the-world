Module project of PSY6422

Data sources  
The data is sourced from a page on [Our world in data](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death). There are five files of data that I downloaded. The author of the page has divided the raw data into five groups by age, including under 5, 5-14, 15-49, 50-69, and 70+. The columns for each group include Entity, Code of country, year, and a number of deaths by cause of death. There are four variables in total: age, year, region, and cause of death.  
These data are collected from a number of institutions, such as, [Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME),Global Burden of Disease (GBD)](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool), [World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory (GHO)](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates), [Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/), [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/death-penalty/)
